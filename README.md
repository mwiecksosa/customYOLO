# Helping Save Toads
- Custom tracking system built to help zoologists at the [Bronx Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_Zoo) study the behavior of the [Kihansi spray toad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kihansi_spray_toad) before being reintroduced into the wild.
- School newspaper [article](https://news.fordham.edu/science/students-use-gaming-technology-to-track-endangered-toads/) written about our project.
